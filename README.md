Word Ladder
===========

Following different solutions to the Word Ladder problem.

Fatvat: http://www.fatvat.co.uk/2010/12/word-ladders.html

Gbacon: http://gbacon.blogspot.com/2007/08/word-ladder-in-haskell.html

DarkOtter: http://darkotter.com/posts/2012-12-04-shortest_word_ladders.html

Both Fatvat and Gbacon are easy to follow solutions, straightforward problem
solving with good enough explanations. But DarkOtter's solution is quite
different. It is not that easy to follow (at least for me). Has a lot of
interesting places in the code presented. Quite a lot to learn from a single
problem solution (need to return to it once again to fully grasp some concepts).
Although I must admit that I didn't get his solution to work (cannot resolve the
compilation errors)
